# üí´ About Me:
I'm your go-to Backend Developer, masterfully juggling API integrations and databases, ensuring all the pieces fit together seamlessly in the puzzle of software development.<br><br>Professionally, I spend most of my time bringing systems together, building bridges between APIs, and maintaining the security and integrity of databases. I've got a knack for making different software dance together in harmony, a conductor of technology, if you will.<br><br>But there's more to me than just server-side tasks and requests; I have a particular fascination with generative AI. The idea of creating something out of nothing, or making systems that can produce their own, unique output is just astonishingly wonderful to me. And guess what? I'm not just fascinated by it - I'm an expert in AI integrations. Machine Learning, Neural Networks, you name it - I love it all!

## üöÄ Skills & Expertise
- **API Integrations:** REST, GraphQL... you name it, I've integrated it.
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, GPT-4 (did you know AI can write creative text too?)
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL and bash scripting are my best pals.

## üé© A Glimpse Into My AI-Led Universe

Navigating the AI cosmos, I've embarked on a host of exciting projects, harnessing the power of OpenAI. Each project has stretched the frontiers of AI applications, redefining the intersection of human creativity and machine intelligence. Here's a snapshot of my AI-powered brigade, each serving as a beacon of my passion and commitment:



üì± **ChatMate:** A WhatsApp AI bot, making conversations smarter and more interactive.
üê¶ **TweetSensei:** A Twitter bot, utilizing AI to automate tasks and generate meaningful engagement.
üí¨ **DiscordAI:** A Discord bot, enhancing server interactions with intelligent responses and commands.

Each project represents a waypoint in my ongoing journey through the vast expanse of AI. They reflect not just my skills, but my excitement for the limitless potential of artificial intelligence. The odyssey continues, and I eagerly await the groundbreaking paths it's bound to carve.

## üé® AI and Me
When I'm not integrating APIs or managing databases, you'll likely find me exploring the exciting world of generative AI. I've built poetry writing bots, AI painters, and even a music composing neural network. So, if you've got an idea that needs AI, or need an AI component integrated into your system, I'm definitely your person!
